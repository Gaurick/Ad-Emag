**Character Creation**

*Select strain*
First your character needs to determine their stable genetic strain, or strain for short.  Between the plague killing off too many people and the syrum mutating most of the rest, many things had to change.  Once the plague settled down the world had a lot more diversity to it than it once did.  The syrum warped and twisted people to a cruel parody of what they once were.  Eventually it was noticed that there were some similarities between people.  Different groups began to band together and thus the strains begain to emerge.  These new strains began to band together for a myrid of reasons.  Comfort, protection, old habbits, the reason doesn't much matter.
Strains serve as a template of common traits that have developed randomly as a result of the syrum.  Each strain gets specific mutations and an extra bonus as well as penality particular to that strain.  You can either select the strain you would like your character to start with or you can roll randomly for it.  For a random selection roll d12 then count through the options until you reach the number you rolled to randomize your strain.  Once you've found your stable genetic strain, make a note of the bonuses, penalties, and mutations from your strain. After that jot down a note or two about any other mutation effects.  Once that's all done, proceed to the attribute section to learn about and determine your attributes.  
It should be noted that if a character is to receive conflicting mutations during creation or even over the course of their adventures, they do not receive both mutations. In the case of two or more conflicting mutations, such as receiving Plastic skin as well as Leaden skin, the most recent mutation overrides the previous mutations.  The older conflicting mutation and all of it's bonuses and penalties are removed.

*Attribute Descriptions*
Attributes are a mechanical way of representing a character’s natural self. Like all traits on a person, given enough time and work, you may improve them as high as you wish. 

Bones are the things that keep you up. It is a measure of how much of physical damage you can take before it’s time for your dirt-nap. This is the one of two attribute that deals with the amount of damage your character can actually take before they become DOA.  It forms the first half of your will to fight and represents the physical damage you can endure before giving up.

Muscles are the things that make you move. It is a measure of your strength and shows how
much you can lift, carry, smash, and how much you hurt in melee combat. Macho buff people are rolling in this attribute. 

Senses is the attribute that encompasses all five of your senses. It is the average of all of your senses, for simplicity sake they are lumped into one attribute. You may have one or more dominant sense, and one or more impaired sense, but this represents the your general awareness of the world around you.

Tendons are what help your muscles move. It is a measure of your general dexterity. It shows how steady your hands are, how fast they are, and how good your reactions are. If you can dodge, dip, duck, and dive, then this is your attribute.

Abstract is the measure of your ability to think differently and consider non-standard solutions.  It also allows you to see through verbal assaults and reinforces your mental will to fight.  Abstract makes up the second half of your will to fight which is the measure of how much verbal and physical damage you can take before giving up in a fight.

Skin is what people notice first when they look at you. It represents your general appearance and how attractive you may appear to other people. Just remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Stored is the measure of the information that you have in your head. If the stat is low, you are not stupid, you just don’t know too many facts about things. The higher it is, the more your brain resembles a library.

Sub-Conscience is the measure of your instinct and intuition. It is the other part of your brain (the one you don’t think about too much) and it represents gut feelings and intuition.  It’s main use is to be used by players who are stuck and need help with what to do next or a character's ability to perform actions a character wouldn't normally be able to perform.

So there is the brief description of your attributes. Next is assigning values to them.  The lowest an attribute can be is d2 and the highest it can be is d12.  The different steps of attributes are; d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12.   No attribute can go lower than d2. In extreme situations attributes can go above d12 to d20, but typically this isn’t something that will happen.  
When creating your character you can either roll randomly to determine your attributes or assign points to your attributes.

To randomly determine your attributes roll a six sided die for each attribute.  Multiply the result of the roll by 2 and that is the number of sides on the die for the attribute.  For example, if you roll a 4 then you would have a d8 for the attribute.  You can either roll eight dice at once and the scores can be distributed as desired or each attribute can be rolled for one at a time in order.

To assign your attributes start by setting all of your attributes to d6.  Next you have 5 attribute step increases you can spend.  Using one step you can increase your d6 attribute to a d8.  Using three step increases will improve your attribute to a d12.  Also if you need more step increases you can lower any attribute down to d4 or even d2.  You then can improve a different attribute by the number of steps you reduced the other attribute by.

*Equivalent Attributes*
Now that you know what your attributes are, you want to see how you compare to the rest of the world. Here’s a list that helps you with just that.
d2 - Horrible- This is absolutely not one of your best points. It is as low as humanly (and inhumanly) possible. It might just be something that you may want to work on when you get some time on your hands.
d4 Average Joe- You are about the same as most other people. You don’t stand out in the
crowd in whatever attribute. You aren’t horrible with it and you won’t win much of anything for it.
d6 - Average Champion- You are beginning to stand outside of the crowd. You are better than
the next person, but when it comes to most adventurers and villains though you are just so-so.
d10 - Great Champion- You are starting to become better at this. You have either gotten lucky, or you have been working to get this good for a long time. Either way, you stand out from the “run of the mill” person. Keep up the good work.
d12 - Epic Champion- You are incredible. Stories about you are told to children, to fill them with a sense of wonder, or dread. that is up to your actions. But regardless, many know of your greatness, and give you your due respect (or fear).
d20 Demigod- You are the greatest around. The ones that are up here with you, you could
probably count on both hands. You have a notorious reputation of heroism, or terror that
follows you where ever you travel.  Not normally an attribute you can achieve.

*Derived Attributes*
Next up since you have the attributes and mutations done, are the derived statistics. They are a little complex at first, but require little adjustment after you make your character.

First Impression- Do you look like you came in dead last in a shovel fight by using your face to block? Can you make dogs whimpier just by looking at them? Or perhaps you make the angels themselves weep with joy
for your face, launch a thousand ships with a sigh, or just get a lot of free drinks?  Well your physical appearance has everything to do with what people first think about. Your first impression can really shoot you in the foot, or save you from fighting in the first place. So here’s the first impressions.
d2 Skin- Disgust. You are so ugly your presence curdles milk. You will need to work on second impressions probably.
d4 Skin- Neutral. You’re normal. Congrats, you blend in with the rest of the world.
d6 Skin- Attraction. You are pretty good looking. If it wasn’t for that nasty scar though...
d10 Skin- Privilaged.  You can and frequently use your looks to get by in life.
d12 Skin- Adoration. Few can tell you, “No”. Even fewer can survive your charms.
d20 Skin- Worship. People fall to their knees at your feet. Have fun with the psycho
stalkers.

Carry Weight- How much stuff you can hold without extra effort.  If you exceed how much you can carry you'll be slowed down until you're so overburdened you can't move.
You can carry a number weighty objects equal to the highest number you can roll for your muscles.

Initiative- The place in the order of combat that your character takes. This derived attribute shows how aware you are of dangerous situations. It is determined by using whatever your senses die is.

Actions- How many things you can do in one turn of combat. There is a minimum of one
action for any character. Your actions are half of the highest roll you can get for your tendons.

Will to Fight- Represents your character's investiment in combat in general.  Includes equal amounts of physical endurance combined with your mental relience.  Your will to fight equals, the highest number you can roll for your Bones plus the highest number you can roll for your Abstract. Once you have both of those numbers combined, double it.  Because you're the main character and you need a pretty strong will to fight.

Intuition- The gut feelings of a character.  The player may either use a use of intuition to get advice from the myth maker or the the player can substitute their sub-conscience score for an attribute on any roll.  Each use returns after a good night's sleep.
Your Intuition equals half of the highest number you can roll with your sub-conscience.

Skill Cost- Learning new skills takes time and effort.  When investing in a new skill, some have a long and drawn out struggle.  Others pickup new skills without more than the minimum effort.  The cost of learning a new skill is based on how many skills you currently know multiplied by a number based on your learnable attribute.  The skill multiplier is,
d2 Learnable- x15
d4 Learnable- x10
d6 Learnable- x5
d8 Learnable- x4
d10 Learnable- x3
d12 Learnable- x2
d20 Learnable- x1

Skills- Speaking of skills, characters have a few to get them through their adventures.  each character has a number of skills equal to the highest number they can roll on their stored die, divided in half.

Total Experience- Not an immersive 3D world, but the total of your character’s experience in this world. As you adventure, mishap, fight, run, live, and love you gain experience. It’s a way to
represent how much your character has grown and matured over the course of their life. Total experience can never go down, unless you get amnesia or get on a soap opera. This number is only for compairison to other characters to see how skilled you are.

Available Experience- This is the amount of experience your character has available to
improve themself. Experience is spent on improving your character’s skills or attributes. After creation characters need to earn their experience yourself.
Available- 100 to begin with

Skills
Next you get to select your character's skills.  You should know your number of skills known by this point.  You either know a skill or you don't.  The following are the skills available for characters.

Fighting- The fine art of up close and personal combat.  Includes whatever esoteric combat methods you need or want.  Such as bare knuckle brawling, elegent fencing, kung fu, and any other merhods of fighting in melee combat.

Shooting- The other method of fighting, at a distance.  Covers different methods ranging from throwing rocks to the use of machine guns.  If you're attacking at a distance, then you're using the shooting skill.

Sneaking- The skill of being able to perform actions, including moving around, without being seen or detected.  Also covers sneaky acts, such as stealing and planting small objects.

Dodging- Dipping, diving, ducking, and dodging are all what this skill includes.  This is the skill to use if you want to avoid physical damage.  When physical damage is coming you can either attempt to dodge or use your armor to soak the damage.

Deceiving- Using false information to convince your target of something.  Covers hiding behind downright bullying, telling a person what they wanted to hear, and adjusting your story on the fly.
Persuading- The fine art of using facts and truth to convince someone to think or believe what you'd like them to believe.  Persuading covers fast talking, begging and pleading, as well as misuse of authority.

Insight- Using your senses, abstract thinking, and general empathy to read other people.  Allows you to get an idea of whats going on inside the mind of other people around you.

Enhancement- Building and beefing up those around you,sometimes even including yourself.  This skill is used to provide boosts and boons to yourself and your fellow adventurers.

Restoration- Some may call it medicine, others call it moral support.  Either way the restoration skill is typically used to fix problems caused by people in violent dissagreement with you and your cohort.

Building- The art of creating new things.  Covers constructing whole buildings, scientific items, and desperate survival shelters.

Upkeep- Fixing and repairing existing things.  Runs the gamut of advanced computer systems to darning socks.
