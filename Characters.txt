Character Creation

Attribute Descriptions
Attributes are a mechanical way of representing a character’s natural self. Like all traits on a person, given enough time and work, you may improve them as high as you wish. 

Abstract is the measure of your ability to think differently and consider non-standard solutions.  It allows you to see through verbal assaults on your will to fight.  Makes up half of your will to fight which is the measure of how much verbal and physical damage you can take before giving up in a fight.

Bones are the things that keep you up. It is a measure of how much of a pounding you can take before it’s time for your dirt-nap. This is the one of two attribute that deals with the amount of damage your character can actually take before they become DOA.  It forms the second half of your will to fight and represents the physical damage you can endure before giving up.

Muscles are the things that make you move. It is a measure of your strength and shows how
much you can lift, carry, smash, and how much you hurt in melee combat. Macho buff people are rolling in this attribute. Puny little weaklings seek to place their attributes elsewhere.

Senses is the attribute that encompasses all five of your senses. It is the average of all of your senses, for simplicity sake they are lumped into one attribute. You may have one or more dominant sense, and one or more impaired sense, but this represents the your general awareness of the world around you.

Skin is what people notice first when they look at you. It represents your general appearance
and how attractive you may appear to other people. Just remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

Stored is the measure of the information that you have in your head. If the stat is low, you are not stupid, you just don’t know too many facts about things. The higher it is, the more your brain resembles a library.

Sub-Conscience is the measure of your instinct and intuition. It is the other part of your brain (the one you don’t think about too much) and it represents gut feelings and intuition that a character may have. It’s main use is to be used by players who are stuck and need help with what to do next.

Tendons are what help your muscles move. It is a measure of your general dexterity. It shows
how steady your hands are, how fast they are, and how good your reactions are. If you can
dodge, dip, duck, and dive, then this is your attribute. If not, then move along.

So there is the brief description of your attributes. Next is assigning values to them.  The lowest an attribute can be is d2 and the highest it can be is d12.  The different steps of attributes are; d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, and d12.   No attribute can go lower than d2.  In extreme situations attributes can go above d12 to d20, but typically this isn’t something that will happen.  
When creating your character you can either roll randomly to determine your attributes or assign points to your attributes.

To randomly determine your attributes roll a six sided die for each attribute.  Multiply the result of the roll by 2 and that is the number of sides on the die for the attribute.  For example, if you roll a 4 then you would have a d8 for the attribute.  You can either roll eight dice at once and the scores can be distributed as desired or each attribute can be rolled for one at a time in order.

To assign your attributes start by setting all of your attributes to d6.  Next you have 5 attribute step increases you can spend.  Using one step you can increase your d6 attribute to a d8.  Using three step increases will improve your attribute to a d12.  Also if you need more step increases you can lower any attribute down to d4 or even d2.  You then can improve a different attribute by the number of steps you reduced the other attribute by.

Equivalent Attributes
Now that you know what your attributes are, you want to see how you compare to the rest of the world. Here’s a chart that helps you with just that.

Equivalent Attributes
d2 - Horrible- This is absolutely not one of your best points. It is as low as humanly (and inhumanly) possible. It might just be something that you may want to work on when you get
some time on your hands.
d4 Average Joe- You are about the same as most other people. You don’t stand out in the
crowd in whatever attribute. You aren’t horrible with it and you won’t win much of anything for
it.
d6 - Average Champion- You are beginning to stand outside of the crowd. You are better than
the next person, but when it comes to most adventurers and villains though you are just so-so.
d10 - Great Champion- You are starting to become better at this. You have either gotten lucky, or you have been working to get this good for a long time. Either way, you stand out from the “run of the mill” person. Keep up the good work.
d12 - Epic Champion- You are incredible. Stories about you are told to children, to fill them with a sense of wonder, or dread. that is up to your actions. But regardless, many know of your greatness, and give you your due respect (or fear).
d20 Demigod- You are the greatest around. The ones that are up here with you, you could
probably count on both hands. You have a notorious reputation of heroism, or terror that
follows you where ever you travel.  Not normally an attribute you can achieve.

Mutations
Now that you know what you want your attributes to be, you can go about modifying them by
your character’s stable genetic strain. Each strain gets specific bonuses and negatives for their
special differences. So find your stable genetic strain and add the bonuses, but subtract the
negatives. When you’re done with that, look up the individual mutations and total up the
bonuses for those as well.
It should be noted that if a character is to receive conflicting mutations during creation or even
over the course of their adventures, they do not receive both of them. In the case of two or more
conflicting mutations, such as receiving Plastic skin as well as Leaden skin, the most recent
mutation overrides the previous mutations.

Derived Attributes
Next up since you have the attributes and mutations done, are the derived statistics. They are a
little complex at first, but require little adjustment after you make your character.

Skill Price- Some people can pick up a skill or trade at the drop of a hat. Other people need to
have everything beaten into their skulls until they figure it out. To represent this each character
pays a specific amount of experience to improve any of their skills. It is determined thus...
Skill Price- 1000 - (Abstract x25)

Flesh is used only to determine the amount of damage that your character can take before they die.
It is derived from...
Base Flesh- Bones x10

Melee Damage- The amount of damage you can do to a person with fists, and can be
augmented by melee weapons. Melee Damage has a minimum value of 1d10. The value is the
number of d10’s rolled per melee attack, not a base number rolled at character creation. It
equals...
1-3 Muscles- 1d10 Melee Damage
4-7 Muscles- 2d10 Melee Damage
8-10 Muscles- 3d10 Melee Damage
11-13 Muscles- 4d10 Melee Damage
14-17 Muscles- 5d10 Melee Damage
18-20 Muscles- 6d10 Melee Damage

Initiative- The place in the order of combat that your character takes. This derived attribute
shows how much of a quick draw your character is. It is determined by...
Initiative- Senses

First Impression- Do you look like you came in dead last in a shovel fight? Can you make
dogs wimpier just by looking at them? Or perhaps you make the angels themselves weep with joy
for your face. Well your physical appearance has everything to do with what people first think
about. Your first impression can really shoot you in the foot, or save your candy ass. So here’s
the first impressions.
1-4 Skin- Disgust. You are so ugly your presence curdles milk. Good luck making
friends.
5-8 Skin- Neutral. You’re normal. Congrats, you blend in with the rest of the world.
9-12 Skin- Attraction. You are pretty good looking. If it wasn’t for that nasty scar
though...
13-16 Skin- Adoration. Few can tell you, “No”. Even fewer can survive your charms.
17-20 Skin- Worship. People fall to their knees at your feet. Have fun with the psycho
stalkers.

Skill Bonus- Everyone is able to bullshit their way through what they know and
succeed at least once or twice in their lives. Characters have all skills under this amount
automatically raised to this value. It does not add to any skills over this amount. It is equal to...
1-3 Stored- All skills are at least 1.
4-7 Stored- All skills are at least 2.
8-11 Stored- All skills are at least 3.
12-15 Stored- All skills are at least 4.
16-19 Stored- All skills are at least 5.
20 Stored- All skills are at least 6.

Intuition- The gut feelings of a character.  The play may either use one to get advice from the myth maker
or the myth maker can use them to give characters hints to avoid calamity.  Each use returns after a good
night's sleep.
1-9 Sub-conscience- 0 hints per day.
10-19 Sub-conscience- 1 hint per day.
20 Sub-conscience- 2 hints per day.

Actions- How many things you can do in one turn of combat. There is a minimum of one
action for any character. It is....
1-4 Tendons- 1 action.
5-9 Tendons- 2 actions.
10-16 Tendons- 3 actions.
17-20 Tendons- 4 actions.

Total Experience- Not an immersive 3D world, but the total of your character’s experience in
this world. As you adventure, mishap, fight, run, live, and love you gain experience. It’s a way to
represent how much your character has grown and matured over the course of her life. Total
experience can never go down, unless you get amnesia or get on a soap opera, only up. This
number is only for compairison to other characters to see how skilled you are. A brief
explination of what to do with your experience can be found after the combat training section,
and an in depth description of experience can be found in the rules section.
Total- Earn this yourself in the course of the game

Available Experience- This is the amount of experience your character has available to
improve herself. Experience is spent on combat training during character creation and/or
improving your character’s skills or attributes. After creation a character must earn their combat
training in other ways, and can no longer purchase it with experience.
Available- 1,000 to begin with

Skills
Your character's starting skills are equal to your character's skill bonus.  If they have any attributes 
that are over 4 they receive a +1 to the skill indicated in the chart below.  This bonus only applies 
when a durring character creation.  If a character raises their attribute over 4 over the course of their
life, then they don't get the bonus.  

Abstract- Tech
Bones- Pilot
Muscles- Melee
Senses- Ranged
Skin- Entertainment
Stored- Medicine
Sub-Conscience- Upkeep
Tendons- Thievery

Skills
Next are the skill descriptions. The following is a quick description of what the skills may or may
not encompass.

Tech- This is the skill that covers a variety of advanced pre-plague and post-plague devices.  Tech
covers the use of computer systems, general electronics, security systems, radios, and 
any other advanced items that look like they came from a sci-fi movie.

Pilot- Skill that covers the moving from one place to another with somehting that isn't your own two
(or more) feet.  Includes cars, trucks, pack animals, piggy back rides, advanced navigation aids,
maps, as well as any other similar skills.  

Melee- How to beat a person.  The skill that covers fighting face to face.  Weapons are optional, but
are covered.  Includes fists of fury, feet, other attached limbs, chairs, swords, chainsaws, clubs, 
and even hammers.

Range- Long range attacks are covered by this skill.  Covers slings, thrown items, rifles, flame throwers,
cannons, and the classic bow and arrow.

Medicine- The skill that keeps people alive.  Covers emergency first aid, advanced surgeries, pharmacy, 
rehabilitation, and herbalism.  

Upkeep- A basic skill to keep your gear, weapons, and armor working well.  Covers the repair of anything 
that a character could run across.  Does not cover any use of the item you repair, just keeping it functioning 
well.

Thievery- Liberating goods from their current owners.  Allows you to pick pockets, pick locks, pick fences,
sneak, avoid detection, and appraise the approximate value of goods.

Skill Equivalents
So now that you have your base skills set out, you want to know how you stack up against the rest
of the world. Here’s something that will help you do that.

Skill Equivalents
1-2 Nonexistent- You haven’t the slightest idea as to what the skill is about, other than what
the name may imply.
3-4 Average Joe- Here is where a “Jack of all traits” would have his skills, enough to make it
look like you know what you are doing, but not enough to really do much of anything at all.
5-6 Average Champion- Here is where most people start to show a better understanding of
the subject. They know what they can do, and what they can’t. They may not be the best ever,
but they know that they can improve, and they do try to improve.
7-8 Great Champion- Here is where you would be considered a “Master”. There are some
things that you don’t know just yet, but you can, and have lived without them.
9-10 Epic Champion- Here is where you are considered the one of the best around. There
are betters, but not many, so enjoy it while you can.
11-15 Super Hero- You could star in your own comic book, if they still existed. But since
they don’t, you will just have to deal with being in stories told around camp fires. Your ability in
this skill is nearly infallible. Your skill is nearly unmatched.
16-20 Greatest Ever- You rock. Plain and simple. Everyone knows about your talents, and
most think that it’s just bed time story. This is the highest a skill can, or will ever get. And at this
level, you are The Man (or The Woman).

Now that you know what your character’s attributes, skills, good points, and bad ones are, it is
time to give her some experience to improve those parts that may need a little work. It isn’t
much, but every character starts off with 1,000 experience to spend as they wish. If they do not
wish, then they can simply hold on to it until a later time. This chunk of experience is due to
characters having their own lives and actions before the characters possessed them. It’s also a
nice gesture so that characters can be tweaked in small ways before the game begins.
The experience can be spent in any way that a normal character can spend it. Characters may
also purchase combat trainings in the beginning to make their characters unstoppable death
machines. Any way that they spend it, it’s theirs to play with. For a more in depth look at
spending experience, see the end of the Rules Chapter. After that it’s time to equip your
character.
