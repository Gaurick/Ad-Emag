Character Creation
Physical description is the next step. Mechanically, it’s useless, but it helps make your characters
a little more personal. The fields are (and not limited to)...
Height- How tall your character is. Are you a towering figure? Or perhaps a short and sly
person.
Weight- How much your character weighs. Is your character as thin and delicate as a
snowflake, or are they tough and meaty?
Eye Color- What color your character’s eyes are. Are they both the same color? Do you have
both eyes? Are your pupils an abnormal shape?
Hair Color- What color your hair is. Is it natural? Do you dye it? If so, what do you use as a
dye?
Hair Style- What the general style of your hair is. Is it a mass of tangles? Or is it always the
picture of perfection? Is it long and full of split ends, or is it short and well trimmed?
Cleanliness- How clean your character tries to keep herself. Do you bathe as often as humanly
possible? Or do you much rather prefer that certain, unclean musk?
Scars- What scars your character possess that are easily noticed. Are you a clean slate? Or do
your scars tell a tale of pain and abuse?
And finally, if you are so inclined, go ahead and write up a quick background on your fellow,
along with a name.
Now for the mechanics of making a character.

Attributes
Attributes are a mechanical way of representing a character’s natural self. Like all traits on a
person, given enough time and work, you may improve them as high as you wish. 

Abstract is the measure of your ability to come up with new and original ideas. Such as
figuring out a plan of action for a siege, or maybe just deciding where a good place to eat is. Also
includes the ability to bullshit without appearing to be doing as such.

Bones are the things that keep you up. It is a measure of how much of a pounding you can take
before it’s time for your dirt-nap. This is the only attribute that deals with the amount of damage
your character can actually take before they become DOA.

Muscles are the things that make you move. It is a measure of your strength and shows how
much you can lift, carry, smash, and how much you hurt in melee combat. Macho buff men are
rolling in this attribute. Puny little girlie men seek to place they attributes elsewhere.

Senses is the attribute that encompasses all five of your senses. It is the average of all of your
senses, for simplicity sake they are lumped into one attribute. You may have one or more
dominant sense, and one or more impaired sense, but this represents the your general awareness
of the world around you.

Skin is what people notice first when they look at you. It represents your general appearance
and how attractive you may appear to other people. Just remember, beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.


Learnable is the measure of how well you can learn new things. If you are the kind of person
whom picks up things quickly, this is for you. If it takes you a little longer than normal, or you
just really prefer to work for a long time on how to do something then perhaps this isn’t for you.




Sub-Conscience is the measure of your instinct and intuition. It is the other part of your brain
(the one you don’t think about too much) and it represents gut feelings and intuition that a
character may have. It’s main use is to be used by players who are stuck and need help with what
to do next.



Metabolism is your digestive system. It is a measure of how quickly your body and mind can
adapt and improve itself. If you are constantly evolving and becoming stronger, smarter, and
faster, then this is for you. If your body is as unchanging and steady as a mountain, then seek
another attribute perhaps.





Tendons are what help your muscles move. It is a measure of your general dexterity. It shows
how steady your hands are, how fast they are, and how good your reactions are. If you can
dodge, dip, duck, and dive, then this is your attribute. If not, then move along.

So there is the brief description of your attributes. Next is assigning values to them.
Every player’s character is given 30 points to distribute among all of her attributes. Every
attribute must be no less than 1 point, and no more than 5 points when you assign your
character’s attributes. Mutations could quite possibly raise an attribute above this number, so the
rule is discarded after the allotment are assigned. After a character is created and the game
starts, the character may raise any of their attributes above 5 points, up to a maximum of 10
points. A character will never have an attribute that goes lower than 1 point, ever. If anything
does happen to alter a character’s attribute below 1 point, then the attribute remains at 1 point
until the character spends experience to improve it.

Equivalent Attributes
Now that you know what your attributes are, you want to see how you compare to the rest of the
world. Here’s a chart that helps you with just that.

Equivalent Attributes
1- Horrible- This is absolutely not one of your best points. It is as low as humanly (and
inhumanly) possible. It might just be something that you may want to work on when you get
some time on your hands.
2- Average Joe- You are about the same as most other people. You don’t stand out in the
crowd in whatever attribute. You aren’t horrible with it and you won’t win much of anything for
it.
3- Average Champion- You are beginning to stand outside of the crowd. You are better than
the next person, but when it comes to most adventurers and villains though you are just so-so.
5- Great Champion- You are starting to become better at this. You have either gotten lucky,
or you have been working to get this good for a long time. Either way, you stand out from the
“run of the mill” person. Keep up the good work.
Character Creation
67
7- Epic Champion- You are incredible. Stories about you are told to children, to fill them
with a sense of wonder, or dread. that is up to your actions. But regardless, many know of your
greatness, and give you your due respect (or fear).
10- Demigod- You are the greatest around. The ones that are up here with you, you could
probably count on both hands. You have a notorious reputation of heroism, or terror that
follows you where ever you travel.

Mutations
Now that you know what you want your attributes to be, you can go about modifying them by
your character’s stable genetic strain. Each strain gets specific bonuses and negatives for their
special differences. So find your stable genetic strain and add the bonuses, but subtract the
negatives. When you’re done with that, look up the individual mutations and total up the
bonuses for those as well.
It should be noted that if a character is to receive conflicting mutations during creation or even
over the course of their adventures, they do not receive both of them. In the case of two or more
conflicting mutations, such as receiving Plastic skin as well as Leaden skin, the most recent
mutation overrides the previous mutations.

To help illustrate how to make a character, we’ll go over the creation of Example Joe. At first glance he thinks that
he wants to roll up an Immune. Upon further reading he discovers that he in fact does not. Being downtrodden and
less than second class isn’t really Joe’s style. So upon even more reading he settles upon the Freaks. They’re fashon
sense makes sense to him. So he takes a fresh character sheet and begins to fill the Physical Description of his
character. After much thought and work the top of his sheet looks similar to this.

Name- Example Joe Player- Me
Sex- It’s a boy!
Age- 24
Height- Tallish
Weight- I’m not fat!
Cleanliness- I don’t smell too terrible
Scars- Hard to say with all the tats.
Hair Color- Black Hair Style- Mohawk, what else?
Eye Color- Green Tattoos/Piercings- Too many for this little space
Birth Region- huh? Stable Genetic Line- Freak
Next Example Joe debates for a long while about his attributes. He doesn’t want to mess things up this early in his
character creation. After much thought Joe finally decides to split his points evenly between his brains and his
brawn. When it comes down to it his Attributes look thusly.
Mental            Physical
Abstract- 2       Bones- 5
Learnable- 4      Metabolism- 1
Senses- 1         Muscles- 3
Stored- 3         Skin- 4
Sub Conscience- 5 Tendons- 2

Joe’s thinking with his attributes is he’d like a character that is tough and a bit smart. That way he can survive
longer and he can rely on the character’s own knowledge since this is his first character and he doesn’t know much
about the world. After working so hard to make his attributes perfect, Joe realizes that he must now modify them
thanks to him being a Freak. After much dread this is what his attributes look like.

Mental            Physical
Abstract- 1       Bones- 5
Learnable- 2      Metabolism- 1
Senses- 1         Muscles- 3
Stored- 4         Skin- 5
Sub Conscience- 5 Tendons- 2

So now Joe is a bit dumber, yet very good looking. The next step for him is the derived attributes

Derived Attributes
Next up since you have the attributes and mutations done, are the derived statistics. They are a
little complex at first, but require little adjustment after you make your character.
Base Flesh is used only to determine the amount of flesh that each part of your character has.
It is derived from...

Base Flesh- Bones
Locational Flesh is the amount of damage any part of your body can handle before it dies,
and when it dies, you are probably not too far away. It goes as such...
Head- Base Flesh x2
Arms- Base Flesh x5
Body- Base Flesh x20
Legs- Base Flesh x10

Combat Training- What kind of training your character has gotten in the ways of attacking.
This could come from ancient kung fu masters, hardened drill instructors, or even a diploma
from schools of hard knocks. More information on some of the possible combat training styles
can be found after the skill descriptions.
Combat Training- Untrained, Boxing, Knife Fighting, Primitive, Football, Action
Movies, Military, or myth-maker’s discretion.

Melee Damage- The amount of damage you can do to a person with fists, and can be
augmented by melee weapons. Melee Damage has a minimum value of 1d10. The value is the
number of d10’s rolled per melee attack, not a base number rolled at character creation. It
equals...
1 - 3 Muscles - 1d10 Melee Damage
4 - 7 Muscles- 2d10 Melee Damage
8 - 10 Muscles- 3d10 Melee Damage

Initiative- The place in the order of combat that your character takes. This derived attribute
shows how much of a quick draw your character is. It is determined by...
Initiative- Senses

Actions- How many things you can do in one turn of combat. There is a minimum of one
action for any character. It is....
Actions- Tendons

Punch- How much damage your character can do if she decides to use their fist to do the
talking. Punch damage equals…
Punch- Melee Damage

Kick- What kind of pain you inflict when you break out your feet of fury. Kicking damage
inflicts…
Kick- Melee Damage +1d10

Grapple- This is the life you can squeeze out of a person if you so choose. This is an attack
who’s damage is only adjusted by the addition of spiney mutations or clothing. Your hugs
cause…
Grapple- No damage unless you possess a mutation or addition to your armor that
specifies otherwise.

KO- KO is knocking someone out. Sending them to the sandman personally. Forcing nap time
on them. It does a small amount of damage to knock someone out, so be careful not to over do
it.
KO- 1d10

Blunt Resistance- Someone laying the smack on you? Blunt resistance is what will keep you
from taking a dirt nap. It is your character’s natural armor against attacks of the bunt damage
variety. For example, punches, kicks, flying chairs, speeding cars, or falling team mates. Blunt
resistance is increased by mutations. Your natural blunt resistance is added to your armor to
protect your squishey flesh points.
Blunt- 0

Disease Resistance- The natural strength your character’s body has when it is faced with
outside forces inside. It’s a measure your body’s resistance to diseases, sickness, poisons, toxins,
and radiation. This attribute begins the same for all characters and can be increased or
decreased by mutations, nasty diseases, smoking, or other mysterious sources.
Disease- 45

Laceration Resistance- Hack and slash protection. This resistance will protect you from cuts,
scrapes, slashes, and nicks. Examples of laceration style damage include, saber cuts, road rash,
and shaving mishaps. Every character begins with a measly 0 for this attribute. Various
mutations will increase this attribute to keep you alive. The laceration resistance enhances your
character’s armor for the purpose of laceration protection.
Laceration- 0

Piercing Resistance- This has little to do with body jewelry and/or the implantation of it.
This kind of piercing is the much more painful type, such as gunshots, flying arrows, impailments
by pike, and harpoon mistakes. Only mutations can improve your character’s natural piercing
resistance. Luckily armor can protect you from piercing damage, and your mutations can only
enhance it even further.
Piercing- 0

Total Experience- Not an immersive 3D world, but the total of your character’s experience in
this world. As you adventure, mishap, fight, run, live, and love you gain experience. It’s a way to
represent how much your character has grown and matured over the course of her life. Total
experience can never go down, unless you get amnesia or get on a soap opera, only up. This
number is only for compairison to other characters to see how skilled you are. A brief
explination of what to do with your experience can be found after the combat training section,
and an in depth description of experience can be found in the rules section.

Total- Earn this yourself in the course of the game
Available Experience- This is the amount of experience your character has available to
improve herself. Experience is spent on combat training during character creation and/or
improving your character’s skills or attributes. After creation a character must earn their combat
training in other ways, and can no longer purchase it with experience.
Available- 1,000 to begin with

First Impression- Do you look like you came in dead last in a shovel fight? Can you make
dogs wimpier just by looking at them? Or perhaps you make the angels themselves weep with joy
for your face. Well your physical appearance has everything to do with what people first think
about. Your first impression can really shoot you in the foot, or save your candy ass. So here’s
the first impressions.
1-2 Skin- Disgust. You are so ugly your presence curdles milk. Good luck making
friends.
3-4 Skin- Neutral. You’re normal. Congrats, you blend in with the rest of the world.
5-6 Skin- Attraction. You are pretty good looking. If it wasn’t for that nasty scar
though...
7-8 Skin- Adoration. Few can tell you, “No”. Even fewer can survive your charms.
10 Skin- Worship. People fall to their knees at your feet. Have fun with the psycho
stalkers.

Skill Price- Some people can pick up a skill or trade at the drop of a hat. Other people need to
have everything beaten into their skulls until they figure it out. To represent this each character
pays a specific amount of experience to improve any of their skills. It is determined thus...
Skill Price- 20 - Learnable in Experience

Attribute Price- Making your body improve itself above it’s normal limits is a very difficult
thing. Some people are able to push their bodies harder and reach beyond their limits with a
little less effort than others. To represent that, the cost for improving a character’s attributes
varies. Read on to find out how.
Attribute Price- 1,000 - (Metabolism x50) in Experience

Minimum Skill Level- Everyone is able to bullshit their way through what they know and
succeed at least once or twice in their lives. Characters have all skills under this amount
automatically raised to this value. It does not add to any skills over this amount. It is equal to...
Minimum Skill- Abstract %

Maximum Skill Level- After a certain point characters just can’t learn anything else about
what they know. When any of their skills reaches this amount they can not increase it anymore,
unless they raise this value first. It is equal to...
Maximum Skill- Stored x20 %

Now our friend Example Joe begins the process of filling in his derived attributes. It takes a little bit and some
though, but he ends up with his derived attributes. And they look like this.

Background
With that confusing business over with, now you can figure out where your character came from.
Every character must roll on the following tables to determine the size and technology of the
region that they came from. Also, where they came from effects how much money they start off
with as well as what their skills start out at.

Region Type
1% - 10% Technological Stronghold- This is a place that is founded upon the ruins of a
scientific building, or worse, a military base. Regardless of where it is, it has access to a heap of
technological goodies.
Starting money- 3d10 x 500

11% - 20% Advanced City- This is a city that is near a dead city. Due to what ever reasons
though, it is not in the dead city. Being so close to a dead city, it wasn’t too difficult for people to
get the electricity and water to flow, and it looks pretty similar to what most think of when big
cities are mentioned.
Starting money- 1d10 x 450

21% - 30% Trade City- This is an area that is at the crossroads of major traveling lanes.
Being such a good location, a great and many people pass through this area. Most that stay earn
their keep by trading what ever goods they may find.
Starting money- 2d10 x 250

31% - 40% Rebuilt City- This is a city that was built upon the skeleton of a former city. It
will never quite the same, and never quite rid of the stench of decay. They are still better than
the other alternatives. The ruins that they are built upon hold untold and unfound treasures.
Starting money- 4d10 x 100

41% - 50% Feudal City- This is an area that is claimed by a powerful ruler. If the ruler uses
words, or weapons to keep this power is their choice. The structure and the technology closely
resembles a medieval city. The castle may be a preexisting tower of steel and glass, or one made
of stone and tin, but there is almost always one in cities such as this, where the ruler looks down
upon their population.
Starting money- 2d10 x 100

51% - 60% Marauder Camp- This is a group of people whom are taking a break between
pillages to rest, count their loot, and lick their wounds. The power depends on the ruler of the
camp and their strength. Their technology depends on their latest excursion.
Starting money- 5d10 x 50

61% - 70% Dirt City- This is a city that tries it’s hardest to be a real city, just like the big ones.
Unluckily it can’t get off the ground. So it sits, not quite a slum, but not quite a city. These are
usually very quiet, peaceful, and a great place to settle down.
Starting money- 3d10 x 50

71% - 80% Wilderness City- This city is but a few mere huts made of local materials and is
usually deep in woods, or some form of local wilderness. People come here to disappear, and
lose themselves. Being in the wild, most supplies are made from what ever is available, not
purchased.
Starting money- 5d10 x 10

81% - 90% Dead City- This is the skeleton of a long lost city that crumbled during the
plague, anarchy, or the power struggle. Regardless of how it fell, it fell quite hard. Never to
become whole again. It’s only townsfolk are adventure seekers, treasure hunters, and sometimes
people hiding away from the world.
Starting money- 3d10 x 50

91% - 100% Wild- This is just a single hut, teepee, or cave in the woods. All by your self, what
ever you may have, you found in the local area. It’s tough living by yourself, but nobody tells you
what to do.
Starting money- 3d10 x 10

Having done all that, you may now figure out what your skill percentages are. Your skills are
based on which region your character started off from.
Back with our friend, Example Joe, he takes a pair of dice and rolls them to see where he’s coming from. The first
die, which he selected to be the tens, comes up with a 7. So he’s got a seventy-something. The second die, which
was naturally ones comes up as 0. This gives Joe a 70 for his starting location. Consulting the chart he discovers
that he is from a dirt city. He must have grown up in a small suburb of some sort. Example then sees that he gets
to roll 3 dice, add them up, then multiply the total by 50. He rolls a 3, 5, and a 0 again. Adding the dice up he
gets 8 (the 0 counts as a zero). He then multiplies 8 by 50 to get a grand total of 400 coin to start with.

Skill Chart
This is a chart with the levels of skills for a character. After you roll for your region then you
assign your skill percentages based on the following chart. After that certain attribute bonuses
add to your skill.

Here is the Rosetta Stone for this chart.
Skill- This is the name of the skill.
Technological Stronghold, Advanced City- If your character is from either of these
regions, then these are the starting values of your skills.
Trade City, Rebuilt City- If your character is from either of these regions, then these are the
starting values of your skills.
Feudal City, Marauder Camp- If your character is from either of these regions, then these
are the starting values of your skills.
Dirt City, Wild City- If your character is from either of these regions, then these are the
starting values of your skills.
Dead City, Wild- If your character is from either of these regions, then these are the starting
values of your skills.

Attribute Bonuses
If you have any of the following attributes are at, or above 4, then your character will receive a
+15% bonus to her skills according to the following chart. This bonus only applies when the
character is first created, and if her attributes go above 4 during the course of the game, then she
does not receive the bonuses. Conversely, if the character’s attributes drop to below 4, the
bonuses are not lost. This is done after the attributes are altered by the mutations she may or
may not possess.

Abstract- Acting, Appraisal
Learnable- Drive, Navigation
Senses- Basic Medicine, Mechanics
Stored- Literacy, Engineering
Sub-Conscience- Music, Religion
Bones- Smithing, Large Melee Weapons
Metabolism- Survival, Tinkering
Muscles- Swim, Throw
Skin- Domestics, Etiquette
Tendons- Dodge, Small Melee Weapons

When we last left our good friend Example Joe, he had rolled for his region. Now he has all of his skills assigned
and he’s going to figure out what skills get bonuses from any of his good attributes. If you remember his attributes,

Skill Equivalents
So now that you have your base skills set out, you want to know how you stack up against the rest
of the world. Here’s something that will help you do that.

Skill Equivalents
0%- Nonexistent- You haven’t the slightest idea as to what the skill is about, other than what
the name may imply.

15%- Average Joe- Here is where a “Jack of all traits” would have his skills, enough to make it
look like you know what you are doing, but not enough to really do much of anything at all.

35%- Average Champion- Here is where most people start to show a better understanding of
the subject. They know what they can do, and what they can’t. They may not be the best ever,
but they know that they can improve, and they do try to improve.

55%- Great Champion- Here is where you would be considered a “Master”. There are some
things that you don’t know just yet, but you can, and have lived without them.

75%- Epic Champion- Here is where you are considered the one of the best around. There
are betters, but not many, so enjoy it while you can.

100%- Super Hero- You could star in your own comic book, if they still existed. But since
they don’t, you will just have to deal with being in stories told around camp fires. Your ability in
this skill is nearly infallible. Your skill is nearly unmatched.

200%- Greatest Ever- You rock. Plain and simple. Everyone knows about your talents, and
most think that it’s just bed time story. This is the highest a skill can, or will ever get. And at this
level, you are The Man (or The Woman).

Combat Training
Combat training is how your character learns how to defend herself. It could be anything from
extensive military training, to learning how to box in the ring, to just making it up as you go. No
matter what kind of training your character may choose, you must pay some of your beginning
experience to “purchase” the training. The cost is listed with each form of training. After
purchasing your combat training, your character gains discounts to specific skills. In mechanical
game terms, your character need only pay half of their normal skill cost amount to purchase the
skills listed with the combat training. As an added bonus, characters gain a pernimant bonus to
the attribute listed. Now if a character is to receive another form of combat training, the mythmaker
is advised to make it a very difficult time. But if they survive the training, they receive the
bonus on top of any other bonuses they may possess from other combat trainings.

Untrained- (0 Experience) You know how to hit someone, and you know which end of the
gun you are suppose point at a person, and that’s about it. Everything you learned you learned
on your own. That isn’t a bad thing, but you take longer to learn the more extravagant combat
moves.
Skill Discount- None.
Bonus- None.

Boxing- (100 Experience) You used to fight a lot. Be it in a ring, or on darkened streets. You
know you like to use your fists, and you also know how to make them hurt. Boxing concentrates
on punches and blocking with your arms. As you grow more knowledgeable, your punches will
“fly like a butterfly, and sting like a bee”, a very painful bee.
Skill Discount- Unarmed
Bonus- +3 to Melee Damage

Knife Fighting- (250 Experience) Perhaps you were the scrawny kid that got beaten up, and
to even the odds, you picked up a knife. Or maybe you just didn’t want the scrawny kid to have
the slightest of chances. Either way, you were hooked when you first wielded a knife. Ever since,
you have used little other than your trusty knife. In the beginning, you aren’t intimidating to
much more than the kids you used to beat up. Given enough time and practice though, you
could tap-dance all over someone’s face without breaking a sweat.
Skill Discount- Small Melee Weapons
Bonus- +3 to Initiative

Primitive- (250 Experience) You grew up in a community where technology was treated as
sacred artifacts, or not even heard of. Your community used primitive tools and weapons to
defend themselves. Not a single man, woman, or child was a stranger to the weapons of your
tribesmen. You learned the basics of melee combat.
Skill Discount- Large Melee Weapons
Bonus- +5 to all Damage Resistances

Football- (500 Experience) Everyone laughed at you when you threatened them with a
football. After everyone else was knocked out, you had the last laugh. A former quarterback that
loved to throw the pigskin around, you decided that other things would be more fun to throw
around. Like things that impale. Or explode.
Skill Discount- Throw
Bonus- +3 Base Flesh

Town Guard- (500 Experience) You did a brief tour as a guard in your hometown. They
taught you the basics of archery and then gave you a bow and quiver. You did your time and got
a bit better at it and then you decided to go off and use what you learned outside of the
claustrophobic walls of your hometown.
Skill Discount- Archery
Bonus- +5 to all Damage Resistances

Action Movies- (750 Experience) You have somehow seen a lot of violence from movies,
video games, music videos, or read about it in books, but no matter how you have experienced it,
you decided that that is how you are going to fight. Since movie making is a sort of “long lost”
art form, you don’t know about the army of minions that work with the star to make them fight
like that. But regardless you still strive to achieve that kind of fighting. At first it is laughable, but
as you progress, who knows?
Skill Discount- Exotic Melee Weapons
Bonus- +3 to Initiative

Military- (750 Experience) You were conscripted to serve in a local military. They taught
you how to wield a crossbow and your fists. Then they threw you into the meat grinder. You
came out alive and deserted your unit. Now armed with your new skills you do as you please and
don’t let anyone push you around anymore.
Skill Discount- Rifles
Bonus- +5 to all Damage Resistances

Now that you know what your character’s attributes, skills, good points, and bad ones are, it is
time to give her some experience to improve those parts that may need a little work. It isn’t
much, but every character starts off with 1,000 experience to spend as they wish. If they do not
wish, then they can simply hold on to it until a later time. This chunk of experience is due to
characters having their own lives and actions before the characters possessed them. It’s also a
nice gesture so that characters can be tweaked in small ways before the game begins.
The experience can be spent in any way that a normal character can spend it. Characters may
also purchase combat trainings in the beginning to make their characters unstoppable death
machines. Any way that they spend it, it’s theirs to play with. For a more in depth look at
spending experience, see the end of the Rules Chapter. After that it’s time to equip your
character.
Now comes the time when Joe would like to spend some of his experience to strengthen some of his character’s
weaker points. He’ll probably never have a rock solid character, but Joe would like to not hamstring himself in the
beginning if he can. So he considers the various combat trainings. At first he likes Untrained so that he can spend
more of his experience making his character awesome. But then he realizes that this could be the only chance his
character has to get combat training of any kind. So he decides on Town Guard for his combat training. It gives
him a neat background to play with and some useful bonuses. Joe finds his damage resistances and adds 5 to each
one. This includes the disease resistance. He then also marks his skill, archery, because it now costs half the
normal experience to increase his archery skill. With the last 500 experience he has left (1000 available - 500 for
town guard combat training) he decides to improve a few of his skills a little bit.
Firstly he increases his archery by 10%. This would normally cost 18 experience per skill %, but since it’s his
discounted skill, it’s only 9 experience to increase it 1%. This takes his archery skill from 25% to 35%. He then
opts to put 5% in unarmed, so if he is ever without bow he won’t be an easy target. His new unarmed skill goes
from 30% to 35%. Finally to make a few extra bucks, hopefully, he adds 5% to his appraisal skill so he can
determine the crap from the phat loots. This final boost brings his appraisal from 20% up to 25%. This leaves
Joe with 230 experience, which he plans on saving for another time. So his available experience becomes 230.
Finally he moves on to purchasing his equipment.
For those interested, Example Joe’s final character sheet (we’re not finished with him just yet…) will appear in the
back of the book. Also appearing back there is the blank character sheet for you to create your own characters
yourself.
