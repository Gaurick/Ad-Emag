Introduction

First off, if you can understand the words on this page, congratulations. Literacy is a rare skill to possess these days. Most would rather learn to do a more functional skill such as hunting, scavenging, or pillaging. Understanding what's written is one thing, understanding about this world in general is another thing. My task was to organize a cohesive collection of information about humanity's past in order to better prepare humanity to struggle existing for just a little longer bit longer. 

Now believe me when I say that this book is by far the most comprehensive source of information available. When I say that, it is not a boast, but a statement of fact. I have put my life into finding, securing, transcribing and preserving the truth of how the world fell into the disgraced state it now lies in. This has been quite an undertaking. 

It turns out not many others are nearly as interested in the preservation of our ancient history as I am. The best stashes of history seem to be secreted in the most foul of places. Libraries’ catalogs reduced to fire starters. Irradiated newspaper archives inhabited by maddened rotters. Video caches under cities that have been reduced to a pile of jagged rubble. There were countless other little slices of misery I braved to get even mere scraps of information. 

With my intention being to allow the accounts I have organized together do all the instruction necessary, I will refrain from interjecting my thoughts and opinions into this work. Alas I will not always be able to have this be the case. Some of the works that I include will require some explanation of one sort or another. In such a case, the best example being this very introduction, I will do my absolute best to keep my commentary as brief, but in depth as possible.

These words I offer to you, with the hope that they teach you something of use.

Best regards,
-Eddie Ikon.

My psychiatrist told me that keeping a journal would help with the therapy, so here I am writing 
about all my little day to day problems. I burned dinner and Allen wasn’t too happy about it, but 
if he would help me with the kid instead of playing on his goddamn computer all the time, then it 
wouldn’t have happened.  I got a call from Timmy’s principal saying that he’s been skipping classes. 
I tried to talk to Allen about it, but he said something about nearly being level 73 or some such nonsense 
and continued to play his games. I swear that I married a child and not a man. If he played with me nearly 
as much as his fucking computer, then this marriage would be a million times better.

March 17
I went to the shrink again, and for the money that I pay him I would think that he would actually 
do something other than tell me to relax. Everyone tells me “just relax” or “calm down”, but when 
I ask them to do something or help me out they tell me the same tired old stories about being too 
busy. Story of my fucking life.  I wish that things would be like they were between me and Allen 
when we first got married.  But after he got his job, it seems that all he does is work, sleep, play, 
and shit.

April 3
I think that Allen finally got the hint. We sent Timmy over to my mother’s house for the
night and he took me out to a nice dinner. It was the first time in as long as I can remember that 
he didn’t use the computer for a whole day. He even did things that we hadn’t done since we had Timmy. 
Somehow I just feel that it is like trying to fix a burnt meal with too much salt.

April 5
Timmy was out of school today because he’s coming down with something. I want to call it the flu, 
but it’s the middle of spring. I’m really starting to worry about him though, so I’ll take him to 
the doctor in the morning. His temperature has been high all day and nothing that I do will cool him 
off. Even the crackpot remedies that Mom told me don’t seem to help him. At least he will be playing 
hooky for a good reason for once.

April 6
After four aggravating hours in the waiting room, I decided that the doctors can’t do anything for 
Timmy. It seems like everyone is getting the flu. It was even on the news tonight.

April 7
Timmy has taken a turn for the worse. He is burning up so much that he is delusional and speaking 
to hallucinations. What scares me is that Allen has now gotten whatever Timmy has.  Whatever it is, 
it’s very nasty. I guess that the house will be pretty full during the day. Just when I was getting 
used to having an empty house.  The news said that this new bug is pretty bad, but they won’t say 
anything else about it. I tried to call the hospital all day and the lines are all busy. I think that 
I’ll take the whole family to the doctor in the morning.

April 13
My son is dead. Even writing these words doesn’t take the numbness away. I have been crying all day 
without realizing it. I can’t believe it. I have read the first four words at the beginning of this 
and it still seems dreamlike. Allen hasn’t gotten out of the bed all day and I feel so alone.

Though it seems like an innocent diary, this is the earliest scrap of writing I was able to find.

A fine book made with the finest materials to keep track of my accomplishments.  Things are moving up and i want to remember every detail possible.

September 19th, 9:13 PM
Profit margins are up for this fiscal quarter. To celebrate this news, I bought a new Fairlane ZX-11. 
It was worth every red cent I paid for it.  I took Lucy out again. She was also worth every penny that 
I spent on her.  Damson, the CFO, has put me in charge of overseas investments. I know that I can do a 
much better job than any of the other junior executives ever could. Now is the time for me to at last 
prove it.

September 24, 7:25 PM
After researching the various investments, I have decided that the best opportunity for our company 
to peruse is to invest very heavily in an up and coming company operating in Hong Kong and Madrid with 
a large presence here in the US by the name of Celestheal.  They had some kind of experimental vaccine 
that they were working on that was generating a great deal of interest. I’m not too sure on the particulars 
because they hid behind a lot of technical jargon. I presented the information to Damson and he gave me 
the go ahead to pour everything we’ve got into it.

October 1st, 12:01 PM
Today the market took a huge loss. This flu, which they’re starting to call, “The Plague” is really 
taking people out of action. This hit to our market was offset by a great rise in both the Asian and 
European markets. Looks like I jumped on the Asian band wagon at exactly the right moment. Celestheal 
is growing by leaps and bounds. I dumped all of my own personal resources I could into it before the 
prices rose too high. I’m going to make a killing thanks to this company.

October 3rd, 11:37 PM
Lucy won’t return my calls. For how much I pay her for a single night’s work, you would think that 
she would at least answer the phone more often. Forget it, I’ll call her again.

October 4th, 8:46 AM
After all the care that I take to keep myself as physically attractive is for naught. My skin is 
drying out and no creams that I try to sue are having any effect on my dry skin. I still can’t get 
a hold of Lucy.

October 4th, 9:33 AM
I finally figured out why Lucy isn’t answering the phone. After a substantial bribe I was told that 
she took a vaccine to help her fight off that flu plague that sweeping the nation. The vaccine that
Celestheal produced. It somehow made her stomach begin eating itself.  What scares me more than that 
is I invested everything I had into the company that produced the vaccine. But the thing that shakes 
me to the core, is that I also took that injection yesterday.

October 4th, 12:33 PM
I can’t ever leave my apartment again. Last I heard, the European market collapsed in on itself.  
The collapse was a direct result of that damn Plague arriving on of our damn planes. And now it’s 
ravaging the countryside. The US market is at record lows and there is no solution possible to fix 
the situation. Asia has sealed it’s borders and won’t allow any details out. I’ve been fired.  All 
my money was invested in a company that turned humans into terrible freaks. What’s the worst part 
of all…
I’m one of those terrible freaks.

October 5th, 3:01 AM
This is the last thing I’m ever going to write. I am now a horrid creature that isn’t human
anymore. My job and finances are all in the toilet. The closest thing to a person that I love died
a wretched screaming death because of a company’s product that I helped fund. I just hope that
the shotgun doesn’t leave much of my hideous face. So I guess the next thing for me to say
would be something cliché like, “Good bye cruel world.”

After all that the Syrum has done to hurt and help so many people, to find an account of someone who was part of it’s creation and distribution!
-edd.

Thursday
Out of an entire buildin’, this was all that was worth takin’. I guess them damn scavs got all the
good stuff. I found this by a stiff. It seems that I see more stiffs than people. Most everyone
that is alive is pretty ugly nowadays. What with that damn syrum thing that messed us all up. It
made some pretty ugly folk that you run into wanderin’ around. Though I guess that I am not
much of a looker anyhow, after catchin that car bomb with my face and all.

Saturday
I was pickin’ at the scabs that make up what is left of my face, when I peeled this off. I think that
I am gonna to keep it here, just in case.

Monday
My head hurts. I had to beat a guy with a board and I ended up takin’ his shoes. They don’t fit
too good, but they’ll keep my feet from bleedin’ so damn much. It really pisses me off that I
have to leave town just because I’m ugly and missin’ most of my teeth. Damn the government
for declaring martial law and “seperating” those of us who got all sorts of messed up by that
Syrum. “For our own protection.” They’s the ones who need protectin’. Just because I had to
be all messed up by that horseshit vaccine to stay alive and that damn car bombd. It’s ain’t my
fault. Well at least I won’t be alone, looks like all of us freaks are getting kicked out of town by
those “holier than thou” government pricks. Fuck ‘em, we’ll build a better town anyway.

Friday
I found the most pretty woman today wanderin’ with the rest of us refugees. Her name is Tracy
and she’s got clear blue eyes. She understands how I feel like none else. I have to be kinda
careful though, if I hug her too tight, her skin tends to fall off in chunks. And after a while I
guess I can get over her smellin’ like something that curled up and died about a month ago with
almonds.

Sunday
Well we finally started that town that I was talkin’ about. We don’t need the government and
their damn martial law to rule our lives. We’ll be able to do it ourselves. Seeing how I used to
work on ‘em a while ago, I get to fix up the power plant. I’m thinkin’ bout takin Tracy out on a
walk soon. She is the prettiest darn thing I ever saw, even if most of her hair is fallin’ out.

Monday
Got the power up and runnin’ finally. Feels like it took forever, but anythin’ worth doin’ is worth
doin’ right. The pompous ass of a mayor came down and rambled on and on and on about how
important that I am to the town and bla bla bla. The guy never shuts up. I think that I’ll live up
here, seein how it’s nice and warm, and nobody ever comes out here, cept when there’s a
problem.

Saturday
Tracy came by, and one thing led to another and now she’s asleep upstairs. She sure is swell.
I’m thinking about marryin’ that woman.

Friday
Well Tracy and I are hitched. We are goin’ out on our honeymoon at the end of the week. I just
gotta teach someone how to keep the juice flowin’ through our grand ol’ town. Man I am so
excited.

Tuesday
Got back from my honeymoon. That damn lackey that I taught fucked up my system. Now I
gotta get things back the way I like ‘em. The mayor is callin’ a meetin’ tonight to complain
about somethin’ or another. That guy never stops bitchin’ and whinin’. The one thing that struck
me was what he said that there were rumors of an all out war breaking out in Europe. Somethin’
bout this bein’ as bad as that great war all those years ago. Seems nasty is all i know.

Sunday
Tracy’s got a bun in the oven! We’re gonna have us a little tike of our own! The Doc checked
both of us out and said something about passin’ on “geen itic ab normie ladys” or some-such
nonsense. Damn doctors always usin’ such big words. Why can’t he just speak English?

Saturday
It’s been a while since I wrote, but I’ve been workin’ on getting my hole ready for the tike and
keeping this town in juice. But I now have a son! His name is John Deck Morris. He’s got
Tracy’s eyes, and my strong jaw. The Doc says that we gotta keep a close eye on him, cus he got
some kinda infection and he smells kinda like almonds Just like my Tracy.

Friday
Went over to the town square and the family got a good ol’ picture taken. Here it is. Ain’t John
just the cutest kid you ever did see?

Wednesday
There were some funny rumors of a bunch o’ people attackin’ from far off. I just thought it was
ol’ Vinne Two Fingers gettin’ into the moonshine too heavily. Still i’m gonna take Tracy and
John to the mountians in a coupla days.

I wasn’t able to find out what happened to them.  
-edd.

I can’t believe that I paid so much for half a notebook, but I required it to keep track of my
day to day activities. First I shall introduce myself; my name is Sarah Unabridged Webster.
Aside from the periodical raids from the local marauders, very little excitement goes on around
here. This is thanks in no small part to the small squad of soldiers posted here that have kept the
others seperate from us.

Some of those other local children were watching me again. They have a look of disgust when
their eyes settle upon me. It is though I bear some unseen stigmata that the others can witness,
but I can’t see. They themselves are the ones who were disfigured by the injection. I can’t help
it if my immune system is stronger than theirs is. I am saddened that the people that I live with
view me with such hatred. I wish that those soldiers would only take me away from all this
squalor and back into one of the great shining cities.

There have been whispers of the others banding together and kicking the normal people out of
Wasserville. This is dreadful news. We’re just trying to help them in their terrible state. The
soldiers are getting nervous about the others. Speaking of soldiers, I had a chance to get to know
one of them better. His name is Stephen and he’s a Corporal. Oh is he georgeous in that uniform
of his. We must have talked for hours on end about everything.

There was a spat between the others and the soldiers today. The soldiers were trying to get an
estimate as to how may others we actually had, seeing how dozens come shuffling in every day.
The others didn’t want the soldiers to come into their precious slum for whatever reason.
Stephen was shot in the arm by one of the others. Of all the places he could have stayed to
recover, he chose my house! He’s sleeping peacefully in the other room right now.
Some of the local hoodlums have took it upon themselves to show me and Stephen just how
unwelcome we are in “their” town. My wounds will heal, but the emotional pain will linger for
quite some time. I can’t believe how they spit in our faces while we try our best to help them
with their condition.

My god. They’ve overthrown the government! All of the freaks that we were trying to help and
find a way to restore to normalcy overthrew our government! I don’t know what I am going to
do. Stephen says that we should try to get to the capital because if there is any government still
around, it would be there.

I can hear the people beating at my door. They must have finally had enough of us. I just
wanted to be with Stephen and be happy. But they just wouldn’t let us. They are coming down
the stairs, if only we had more time to leave. I don’t want to die like th-

Ah love blooming under dire circumstances.  It warms my heart.

I ned to kep trak of MY thee first kil of the MIGHTY KARL 7.62 BALL. I keep this as a
log of the great konquests that I am sure to hav. On this day MY felow kilrs and I have kild over
31 people. Three wer MY victims. There wer few spoils to take, but the foods made it worth it.

7
I, the POWERFUL KARL 7.62 BALL hav kild the rats that snuck into MY tent this night. The
rats were once best mates of MINE who wished to overthrow ME in MY command of MY men.
I was unabl to get information from the vermin before they died. Only a fool would send three
tiny boys to kil the POWERFUL KARL 7.62 BALL.

10
I am happy to say that I found a family living along the road we were going on. I hadn’t kild
anyone in a month and I was geting bothered. KARL 7.62 BALL, the MAGNIFICENT
slaughtered the family of five before anyon knew what I was doing. The house contained
nothing worth keeping.

13
Our patrol cam upon an enemy patrol of the despicabl hick military. They ran and hid away from
us. It took MY valiant troops the better part of the day to destroy them. While interrogating
their cowardly leader I, the TERRIFYING KARL 7.62 BALL learned that the inferior hick
military here demonstrated their cowardice by unleashing their nuklear arms on our home land.
For this act of cowardac, we will ravage their landscap.

14
We have captured another soldier who has told us, after much interrogation, that the foolish hick
military have let loose chemical weapons on our allis. He told ME, the ALL
KNOWING KARL 7.62 BALL, Knows that we are made of honor, valor,
and truth!

19
Tomorow the UNDEFEATABLE KARL 7.62 BALL and HIS INVINCIBLE army wil meet their
enemies, the hick swine, on the field of battl. I know in MY heart we shal be
victorious.

This makes my head hurt.  This is why you need to pay attention when you’re in school.
-edd.

This is a roll playing game. To play it you will need a few items. This book, paper, copies of the
included character sheets, some 10 sided dice (2 to 10 should be enough), an open mind, and an
imagination. You will also need at least two people. One person will serve as the Myth-Maker
who’s job is to run the entire world. Every person, the weather conditions, animals, shrubs, even
clouds of noxious gas is controlled by the myth-maker. Except for the player’s characters, who
are controlled by the rest of the players of Ad Emag.

World View
The world has been through quite a few dramatic changes, so here is something to bring you up
to date on what the world is like now.
The world in general
Earth isn’t the fertile garden that it used to be. Due to the plagues, warfare, and chemical
warfare unleashed on such an grand scale, most of the world is a desolate wasteland. The few
areas that aren’t corrupted are zealously protected by the people and creatures living there. On
the majority, the world is polluted by radioactive fallout, defoliants, chemicals of all varieties, or
the ashes of civilization.  Most information about areas outside the nearby towns is full of rumors, myth and mostly forgotten geography.
