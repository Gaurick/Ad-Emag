Armor
Any person who is worth their salt realizes that you can not survive a battle for very long without
some form of protection. Protection that you wear is called armor, and it may be anything from
a bullet proof vest, the clothes you wear, to a suit made from animal bones. Whatever it may be,
you are probably wearing it to protect you, even if you are trying to make a fashion statement at
the same time.
Since every material is different in how it absorbs damage, here is the chart on what the material
may be, and how much damage it absorbs before your character has to deal with it. Also, the
price listed is per location, not for a whole suit. So if you want a full suit of leather, you must buy
it for the six parts of your body. It may be noted, that this may be an extensive list, you are free
to try to use something else for a form of armor, just try to figure out the stats and speak with the
myth-maker about it.

Vehicles
Anyone will tell you that the fastest way from point A to point B is a straight line, but it’s even
faster with a cool set of wheels or wings. This section will deal with the wonders of vehicles.
Vehicles are divided into three groups, land, water, and air vehicles.
Land vehicles of course travel on the ground. They primarily remain on the earth and don’t
tend to fly or float too well. They include cars, trucks, and bikes.
Water vehicles travel through the various bodies of water. Depending on how large they are, and
how heavy they are, they may travel the oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and even the creeks. They
include boats, jet skis, and hydrofoils.
Air vehicles fly through the air. They may move a bit on the land or the sea, or even both, but
they spend the most time in the air. Unluckily fuel and parts to keep the vehicles up in the air is
painfully expensive, difficult to find, and the parts are very fragile. So they don’t usually last for
very long. They include airplanes, helicopters, and blimps.
And here is the list showing most of the vehicles you may (or may not) run into.
