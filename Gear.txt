Armor
Any person who is worth their salt realizes that you can not survive a battle for very long without
some form of protection. Protection that you wear is called armor, and it may be anything from
a bullet proof vest, the clothes you wear, to a suit made from animal bones. Whatever it may be,
you are probably wearing it to protect you, even if you are trying to make a fashion statement at
the same time.
Since every material is different in how it absorbs damage, here is the chart on what the material
may be, and how much damage it absorbs before your character has to deal with it. Also, the
price listed is per location, not for a whole suit. So if you want a full suit of leather, you must buy
it for the six parts of your body. It may be noted, that this may be an extensive list, you are free
to try to use something else for a form of armor, just try to figure out the stats and speak with the
myth-maker about it.
