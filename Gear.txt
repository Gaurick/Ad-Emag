Money
After the dust settled, everyone realized that the paper money wasn’t worth the paper that it was
printed on. Mostly because the government that backed it was nonexistent, and the paper was
wasted. So everyone ended up deciding that coins were still worth while, due to the fact that they
were made of metals that could be used for tasks other than paying for goods or services. So the
coins became a new form of currency. Due to a new utilitarian point of view, the value of each
coin was altered. So here’s the new list of coin values.

Silver Dollar- $100
Fifty Cent Piece- $50
Quarter- $25
Nickel- $10
Penny- $5
Dime- $1

Ranged Weapons
Ranged weapons are weapons that are used from a distance. They send various projectiles or
other objects outward faster than you can throw them. If you don’t wish to see the look of pain
and fear on your enemies face, then ranged weapons are for you.
Ranged weapons are divided into five general categories. The first category would be thrown
weapons. They are weapons that you throw at your enemies. Helpful in a pinch and allow you
to keep a good distance from your targets. They include, ninja stars, throwing knives, hand
grenades, and rocks.
The second category would be primitive ranged weapons. They are weapons that use simplistic
strings to launch small projectiles further than a person could throw them. They may be a
primitive and simple way of doing things, but they are effective. They include, bows and arrows,
crossbows, and spear cannons.
The third category would be pistols. They are smaller weapons that can be typically used with
one hand. You may opt to use both if you wish, but they are designed for one hand. They
include, pistols, revolvers, and submachine guns.
The fourth category would be rifles. They are firearms that use much longer bullets than pistols.
They have much more of a chance of penetrating armor, but do not do as much damage as a
pistol would. They include, hunting rifles, assault rifles, and shotguns.
The final category would be support weapons. They are any ranged weapons that do not fit in
the other category. They are the odd ball weapons and without proper knowledge they can be as
much damage to the user as the targets. They include machine guns, cannons, and flame
throwers.

Here is what they are suppose to mean...
Name- What the ammo is called, and it’s category.
Damage- How much the ammo hurts when you get shot.
Notes- Anything you may need to know about the ammo in question.
Value- The range of how much the ammo is worth. It’s price depends upon the supply and
quality of the ammunition. It is per round or gallon, not per clip or tank full.

Armor
Any person who is worth their salt realizes that you can not survive a battle for very long without
some form of protection. Protection that you wear is called armor, and it may be anything from
a bullet proof vest, the clothes you wear, to a suit made from animal bones. Whatever it may be,
you are probably wearing it to protect you, even if you are trying to make a fashion statement at
the same time.
Since every material is different in how it absorbs damage, here is the chart on what the material
may be, and how much damage it absorbs before your character has to deal with it. Also, the
price listed is per location, not for a whole suit. So if you want a full suit of leather, you must buy
it for the six parts of your body. It may be noted, that this may be an extensive list, you are free
to try to use something else for a form of armor, just try to figure out the stats and speak with the
myth-maker about it.

There are a few categories on the armor chart, and here is what they mean…
Name- What the material is usually called.
Blunt- The amount of blunt damage that the armor absorbs before it damages your character.
Laceration- The amount of laceration damage that the armor absorbs before it damages your
character.
Piercing- The amount of piercing damage that the armor absorbs before it damages your
character.
Description- What the armor is.
Notes- Any special things you may need to know about your armor.
Value- The usual price, varied by the supply, and quality of the armor.

Notes
Every suit of armor is different, and here are the special effects that happen to suits of armor
when it is hit by a specific type of damage.

Flammable- This when this material comes in contact with fire, or extreme heat, it will catch
fire.
> If attacked by fire has a 75% chance of catching fire, and you suffer additional fire damage.
Shatters- This material is fragile, and if it takes too much damage, it will shatter into pieces
there by making it completely useless.
> If the attack exceeds the amount of damage that the armor can absorbs, it shatters, destroying
it completely.

Large and Bulky- This material is very large, cumbersome, and generally not fun to wear all
the time. If you do decide to (or have to) wear it you suffer penalties to Muscles and Tendons.
> While wearing suffer -2 to Muscles and Tendons.

Heat Reduction- This material distributes heat very well and doesn’t catch fire very easily.
When you are hit by any form of heat or flame, the armor will reduce the amount of heat
damage that you receive. This also applies to damage done by fire and flame based weapons.
> Reduces all heat damage by half.

Heats Up- This material absorbs heat and doesn’t displace it very well. Wearing it when
attacked by any form of heat causes it to heat up to painful levels, thereby doing more damage
than good.
> When attacked by heat, after the first turn does an additional 2d10 damage for every turn that
the armor is heated up.

Chips- This material when damaged will lose pieces of itself, until it literally falls off of your
body.
> When attacked, the armor takes double the damage that is dealt to it.

Don’t know what it all means? Here’s something to help with that.
Name- What it is called.
Description- What it is.
Use- What they are used for.
Value- What the item is worth, dependent upon the supply and quality.

Vehicles
Anyone will tell you that the fastest way from point A to point B is a straight line, but it’s even
faster with a cool set of wheels or wings. This section will deal with the wonders of vehicles.
Vehicles are divided into three groups, land, water, and air vehicles.
Land vehicles of course travel on the ground. They primarily remain on the earth and don’t
tend to fly or float too well. They include cars, trucks, and bikes.
Water vehicles travel through the various bodies of water. Depending on how large they are, and
how heavy they are, they may travel the oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and even the creeks. They
include boats, jet skis, and hydrofoils.
Air vehicles fly through the air. They may move a bit on the land or the sea, or even both, but
they spend the most time in the air. Unluckily fuel and parts to keep the vehicles up in the air is
painfully expensive, difficult to find, and the parts are very fragile. So they don’t usually last for
very long. They include airplanes, helicopters, and blimps.
And here is the list showing most of the vehicles you may (or may not) run into.
