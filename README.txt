++Introduction.++
So this is the whole of the post apocalyptic role playing game (quite a mouthfull) 
i've been working for over 10 years... It's a pretty big mess, and it was suggested 
at Adafruit that any kind of writing can be dumped here on Git (including novels).  
I really liked the idea of version control and being to see the actual changes from 
one version to another.
So thus it is here.

even more messy than 1.08.

v1.08
latest "complete" version.
that's 8 previous "complete, i won't touch it ever again" versions thus far.

v1.09
TBA

++To Do.++
Apply the changes i've already debated (hidden in google's drives).
Form into a cohesive and less rambly mass of writing.
Make the rules less like Rifts and more simplified (maybe even my own.)
Stop using commas and parenthesis in notes (and the rest of the document).
Fill with entertaining and not misspelled words.

Simplify the system to be only d10 based (no percentiles).
OR change everything to be only d20 based instead (attributes are converted to a 1-20 system already.)
Reduce the number of skills, derrived attributes, and maybe attributes.
Remove birth cities and drop descriptions somewhere narratively.
Set base skills to start/come up with system to get starting skills (now d10 based, not percentile).
Streamline gear to be less inclusive.
Get mutations formatted (.csv maybe?  some kind of ascii-art chart?).
Make Myth-Maker section not stupid (or just replace with a tutorial adventure?)
Get vehicles not stupid/remove completely and deal with later.
Standardize mutations, armor, weapons, and personal damage to give a nice happy range of possibility.
Give armors different names (or even change the substance).
Standardize prices/values/starting monies to have a nice range of options/values.

Come up with an anagram for insects.
Come up with an alternate to the Born Again Satanists.
Come up with an alternate for the Australian insults/rewrite that intro.
Rewrite/adjust the Leathernet intro.
Look into changing the beastary around a bit to be less boring.
