++Introduction.++
So this is the whole of the post apocalyptic role playing game (quite a mouthfull) i've been working for over 10 years... It's a pretty big mess, and it was suggested at Adafruit that any kind of writing can be dumped here on Git (including novels).  I really liked the idea of version control and being to see the actual changes from one version to another.
So thus it is here.

++Notes.++
Nothing too substantial yet.  Just want to be able to dump thoughts here for the whole of the system.  Need to impliment the changes i've been poking around with for some time.  Figured i would put the latest full version up and then work from there.

++Versions.++
v0.1 - v1.07
all kept on various computers and cloud storage.
may upload one of these days for archival.
even more messy than 1.08.

v1.08
latest "complete" version.
that's 8 previous "complete, i won't touch it ever again" versions thus far.

v1.09
TBA

++To Do.++
Apply the changes i've already debated (hidden in google's drives).
Form into a cohesive and less rambly mass of writing.
Make the rules less like Rifts and more simplified (maybe even my own.)
Stop using commas and parenthesis in notes ().
