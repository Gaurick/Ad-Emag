++Introduction.++
So this is the whole of the post apocalyptic role playing game (quite a mouthfull) 
i've been working for over 10 years... It's a pretty big mess, and it was suggested 
at Adafruit that any kind of writing can be dumped here on Git (including novels).  
I really liked the idea of version control and being to see the actual changes from 
one version to another.
So thus it is here.

++To Do.++
(this version)
Form into a cohesive and less rambly mass of writing.
Make the rules less like Rifts and more simplified (maybe even my own.)
Stop using commas and parenthesis in notes (and the rest of the document).
Fill with entertaining and not misspelled words.

Change everything to be only d20 based instead, mostly the massive rules and cookie cutter 
  re-write
Make Myth-Maker section not stupid (or just replace with a tutorial adventure? or remove for now?)
Put vehicles back in not stupidly.
Fill in the missing descriptions for the remaining items.
Look into changing the beastary around a bit to be less boring.
Adjust the cookie cutter villains to accept the new rules.

Come up with an anagram for insects.
Rewrite/adjust the Leathernet intro.

(next version, or later on)
Get mutations formatted (.csv maybe?  some kind of ascii-art chart? html?).
Standardize mutations, armor, weapons, and personal damage to give a nice happy range of possibility.
Give armors different names (or even change the substance).
Standardize prices/values/starting monies to have a nice range of options/values.
