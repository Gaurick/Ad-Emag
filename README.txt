++Introduction.++
So this is the whole of the post apocalyptic role playing game (quite a mouthfull) 
i've been working for over 10 years... It's a pretty big mess, and it was suggested 
at Adafruit that any kind of writing can be dumped here on Git (including novels).  
I really liked the idea of version control and being to see the actual changes from 
one version to another.
So thus it is here.

++To Do.++
(this version)
Form into a cohesive and less rambly mass of writing.
Make the rules less like Rifts and more simplified (maybe even my own.)
Stop using commas and parenthesis in notes (and the rest of the document).
Fill with entertaining and not misspelled words.
Make whole game based on the stories and exploits of post apoc heroes (they probably end tragically).

Put mutations, armor, weapons, items, and strains into a spreadsheet for ease of manipulation and balance.
Using above spreadsheet figure out cash value and/or xp value of everything (maybe a 1:1 for xp to monies?)
Fill in the missing descriptions for the remaining items.
Healing = 5 flesh/week (or per day for cancerous)
Figure out Syrum system and stick with it (probably leaning to the simpler side).

Change everything to be only d20 based instead, mostly the massive rules and cookie cutter 
  re-write including out of combat and in combat behavior.
Make Myth-Maker section not stupid (or just replace with a tutorial adventure? or remove for now?)
Put vehicles back in not stupidly.
Change the beastary around a bit to be less boring (more hybrids, or post-apoc, or just different?).
Adjust the cookie cutter villains to accept the new rules.
Fill in reference document with references for consistency of stuff.

Ideas
(next version, or later on)
Give armors different names (or even change the substance).

Make Syrum rules.
  Have pool of them (20? Based on an attribute?)
  Need to have 1 at the end of a day or take 1 flesh damage
  Can be "spent" to do stuff
    1 Syrum for 1 attribute or skill for 1 min.
    1 Syrum point to extend attribute or skill bonus by 1 min.
    1 Syrum to heal 5(?) flesh over 5 min (or over 5 sec for cancerous)
    1 Syrum to purge 1 poison.
    1 Syrum to purge 1 disease.
    10 Syrum to remove 1 mutation.
  Every drop of Syrum spent per day results in 1 mutation over the next rest.
